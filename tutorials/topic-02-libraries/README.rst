Topic 2: Libraries
==================

The CSL compiler comes bundled with a few standard libraries, which can be
imported into the user's program using the ``@import_module()`` builtin.  This
example shows three such compiler-bundled libraries:

* the ``random`` library for generating uniform random numbers,
* the ``timestamp`` library for reading the on-chip timestamp counter, and
* the ``math`` library for square root.
