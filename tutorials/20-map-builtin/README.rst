@map Builtin
============

The ``@map`` builtin can be used to perform custom operations on the data elements of
one or more DSDs. In other words, it is a *customizable DSD operation* that allows us
to go beyond the `fixed list <../../Language/Builtins.rst#builtins-for-dsd-operations>`_
of natively supported DSD operations.

This example demonstrates three use-cases of the ``@map`` builtin:

1. In the first use-case, ``@map`` is used to compute the square-root of the diagonal
   elements of a 2D tensor.
2. In the second use-case ``@map`` is used to perform a custom calculation with a mix
   of input DSDs of various kinds (``mem1d_dsd`` and ``fabin_dsd``) and scalar values while the
   result is stored to a ``mem1d_dsd``. It shows how we can use arbitrary callbacks
   combined with a variety of input and output DSDs.
3. Finally, we demonstrate how ``@map`` can be used to compute a reduction like the
   sum of all elements in a tensor.

Without ``@map``, we would have to write explicit loops iterating over each element involved
in these computations. With ``@map`` we can avoid writing such loops by utilizing the DSD
descriptions which specify the loop structure implicitly. Since DSDs are supported natively by the hardware,
using ``@map`` can lead to significant performance gains compared to writing explicit loops.
