GEMV
====

This example shows a CSL program that performs generalized matrix-vector (GEMV)
multiplication operation of the form:

.. code-block:: text

    y = Ax + b

where:

- ``A`` is a tensor of shape [M, N] (stored distributed on PE memory).
- ``x`` is a tensor input of shape [N, 1] (streamed in).
- ``b`` is a tensor input of shape [M, 1] (streamed in).
- ``y`` is the tensor output of shape [M, 1] (streamed out).

For simplicity, we choose M as a multiple of the
height of the kernel and N as a multiple of the width of the kernel.
In this example, M = 32, N = 16 and we use a PE-rectangle (kernel) of
size 4×4.

Below is a visualization of the kernel interface:

.. _fig-gemv-4-by-4-checkerboard:

.. figure:: ./images/gemv-4-by-4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 980 px

Note that this algorithm and the implementation are not optimized for
performance. It is intended to serve as a non-trivial introductory example.

All computations are done in FP16 format.

The matrix ``A``, of shape [M, N],
is distributed across the PE memories as follows:

- The first dimension of ``A``, M rows, is distributed across
  the height of the kernel.
- The second dimension of ``A``, N columns, is distributed across
  the width of the kernel.

Since we know that M is 32 and the height of the kernel is 4, each PE will be
assigned 32÷4 = 8 rows of ``A``.

Similarly, each PE will get 16÷4 = 4 columns of ``A``. This means each PE is
assigned an 8×4 chunk of the original matrix ``A``.
