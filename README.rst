CSL Examples
============

This repository contains examples of CSL code. Each example has the following
properties:

* The source code is complete and self-contained and can be compiled using the
  CSL compiler.
* The compiled code can be simulated using our fabric simulator, or it can be
  executed on the Cerebras hardware itself.

Each example is located in its own sub-folder, and contains files of the
following types:

* ``\*.csl`` : CSL source code files. If there is more than one CSL source
  file, the top-level file, specified when compiling, will import all other
  CSL files.
* ``run.py``: This script drives the simulator (or the Cerebras fabric itself).
  It creates input data, runs the simulator, gets the simulation result and
  compares to an expected result, also computed in this file.
* ``commands.sh``: Shell script which contains the exact commands you need to
  execute to first compile the source code and then simulate it.
* ``\*.rst``: Documentation.

The examples are divided into two main categories, tutorials and benchmarks,
described in the following sections. Each of these categories is further
subdivided into ``SdkRuntime`` and ``CSELFRunner`` directories, denoting
the host runtime used by the program. ``CSELFRunner`` is our legacy runtime,
and ``SdkRuntime`` is our newer runtime, which features
much faster IO performance.
In the future, the ``CSELFRunner`` runtime will be deprecated.

Tutorials
---------

This is the place to start.
There are 7 ``SdkRuntime`` tutorials which teach basic language features by
building up an increasingly complex code to compute a GEMV.
There are additionally 23 tutorial examples for the legacy ``CSELFRunner``,
each illustrating a specific language feature in more detail.

Benchmarks
----------

The material in the ``benchmarks`` folder contains more complex
sample applications solving specific computational problems.

The sample applications for ``SdkRuntime`` are:

* ``gemm-collectives_2d``: Implements generalized matrix-matrix multiplication
  (GEMM) using the ``collectives`` library.
* ``residual``: Computes the norm of the residual of a matrix-vector
  multiplication. 
* ``stencil-v2``: A 3D 25-point stencil finite difference code for solving a
  wave equation with a source perturbation.
* ``bandwidthTest``: Benchmarks the bandwidth of data transfers between host
  and device using the ``memcpy`` framework and the ``SdkRuntime`` host API.
* ``spmv-hypersparse``: Computes a sparse matrix-vector product using a
  hypersparse matrix.
* ``stencil-3d-7pts``: Computes a sparse matrix-vector product using a matrix
  generated by a 7-point stencil.
* ``powerMethod``: Implements the Power method to compute the eigenvector
  of the largest eigenvalue of a matrix generated by a 7-point stencil.
* ``conjugateGradient``: Implements the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method to 
  approximate the solution to a system of linear equations ``A*x = b``,
  where ``A`` is a matrix generated by a 7-point stencil.
* ``preconditionedConjugateGradient``: Implements the Preconditioned Conjugate
  Gradient method (PCG) to approximate the solution to a system of linear
  equations ``A*x = b``, where ``A`` is a matrix generated by a 7-point
  stencil.
* ``bicgstab``: Implements BiCGSTAB to approximate the solution to a system of
  linear equations ``A*x = b``, where ``A`` is a matrix generated by a 7-point
  stencil.

The sample applications for the legacy ``CSELFRunner`` are:

* ``gemv-checkerboard-pattern``: This is arguably the simplest application and
  therefore a good place to start. It implements generalized matrix-vector
  multiplication in about 100 lines of CSL.
* ``gemv-collectives_2d``: Implements GEMV, like the previous example, but uses
  the ``collectives`` library.
* ``gemm-collectives_2d``: Implements generalized matrix-matrix multiplication
  (GEMM) using the ``collectives`` library.
* ``wide-multiplication``: Implements multiplication of two 128-bit unsigned
  integers in approximately 100 lines of CSL.
* ``FFT``: Implements 1D and 2D Discrete Fourier Transforms, DFT in 400+ lines
  of CSL.
* ``residual``: Computes the norm of the residual of a matrix-vector
  multiplication. Builds on the ``gemv-checkerboard-pattern`` example.
* ``histogram-torus``: A communication demo. The fabric memory is filled with
  random values which are then sorted into buckets, where each bucket is a
  single processing element of the WSE.
* ``mandelbrot``: Computes a visualization of the Mandelbrot set on a 16x16
  grid of PEs.
* ``cholesky``: Computes the Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric positive-
  definite matrix.
* ``stencil-v2``: A 3D 25-point stencil finite difference code for solving a
  wave equation with a source perturbation.

Branches
--------

For each release of the SDK, there is a corresponding release tag in this
repository which contains a version of the CSL examples which are compatible
with that SDK release. For example, the tag ``rel-sdk-0.8.0`` in this
repository contains a version of the CSL examples which will work (compile and
simulate) with the SDK 0.8.0 release. The ``master`` branch is identical to the
newest release.

Full backward compatibility of the SDK is not guaranteed.
This means that a CSL example compatible with an older SDK release may not work
with a newer SDK release.
