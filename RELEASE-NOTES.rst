Release Notes
=====

The following are the release notes for the CSL Examples repository, `csl-examples`.

Version 0.5.1
-----------------

This is the second release of the CSL Examples repository. The example codes provided here continue to remain in the standard SDK distribution but Cerebras is beginning to use this repository as a way of interacting more directly with partners and clients. 

New for this version of the csl-examples github repo are the mandelbrot, residual-memcpy, stencil-memcpy, and stencil-v2 benchmarks. 

All examples are 100% compatible with the `0.5.1 release of the SDK <https://sdk.cerebras.net>`_.

Please refer to the `README.rst` file for information on the general repository structure.

Version 0.4.0
